# Analog Photography Collection

2019 was the beginning of my analog photography experience. Here I will try to collect some of my photos. I use different methods for processing of color and black & white negative films such as [Caffenol](https://caffenol.com.br/en/) and [C41 Digibase](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/236651-tutorial-rollei-c41-digibase-color-film-development) methods.

## Photographing Climate Protest

I really enjoy archiving the banners that people create and use in the protests. People are very creative in delivering their messages to the government and policy makers. Archiving banners, for me, is a form of remembering our collective protest memory. More photos are on my instagram [account](https://www.instagram.com/nat.arslan/). I took these photos with my Minolta Hi Matic AF2 and Kodak 400 color film. The protest took place in Stockholm, Sweden on September 2019.
