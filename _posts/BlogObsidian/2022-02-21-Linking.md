Let's try to create a link to the other file with the Obsidina way. I havent installed any gems yet. Someone created a gem that Add wikilinks (double squarebrackets--which is Obsidian way) support for jekyll.

Below is a link to images file (in double square brackets):
[[LitNotes/2022-02-21-Images]] This doesnt work as it is now. I need to try this new gem (plugin) called Jekyll Wikilinks

## Jekyll Wikilinks Plugin (Gem)
github [page](https://github.com/manunamz/jekyll-wikilinks)
Didnt work

## Possible solution
Post some stuff and add its url link to another post you want to link it with.
