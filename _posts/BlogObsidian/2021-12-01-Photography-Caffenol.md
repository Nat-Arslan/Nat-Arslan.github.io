So I finally developed a film roll with the Caffenol technique.

Note: I had been having difficulties with focusing using my Minolta Hi Matic F’s rangefinder under a sunny day.

In 1995, a class led by Scott Williams in Rochester Institute of Technology found a photographic film developing technique using standard household items ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffenol)) such as coffee and sodium carbonate. This process is now called _Caffenol_.

I used the recipe shared in [this](https://caffenol.com.br/en/) webpage to create the mixture. In my first trial I had all the ingredients except sodium carbonate. I only had baking soda available to me which is sodium **bi**carbonate. I read in some blog posts and watched some videos where people converted s. bicarbonate into s. carbonate by heating it up. I failed big time (!) and my kitchen was under fog and had a weird smell for several hours. So I decided to just order s. carbonate from an online store fore cleaning materials (It wasn’t available in common stores).

My second trial was successful if you don’t consider my failure in using the rangefinder focusing in my Minolta Hi Matic F. Usually focusing using the rangefinder in Minolta is rather strait-forward but under some light conditions the focus dot in the rangefinder is not very visible.
