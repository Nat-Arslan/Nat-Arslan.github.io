**Before you publish this check the project and try to understand why you wrote 2008 in the title and in the text. Shouldnt it be 2018?** 

**If it should be 2018, try to find photoshop files**

In the course _GIS and Visualisation_ we were given a task to deliver the the results of our research in a poster which was then printed. The aim was to communicate a scientific research to the public using cartographic design. The visualisation was especially important in this assignment. The scale of the maps, symbols and color and amount of generalisation was among many things to consider. Here is the final product. The analysis is done together with a classmate and the poster design is done by me in Photoshop.

Software used in this project:
- ArcMap
- ArcScene
- Photoshop

Satellite data used for analysis:
- MODIS
