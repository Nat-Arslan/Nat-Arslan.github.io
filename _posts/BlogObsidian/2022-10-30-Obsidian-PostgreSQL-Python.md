I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to write down notes and my journal in markdown format. There is an Obsidian [plugin](https://github.com/clouedoc/postgresql-obsidian) which makes it easy to send the metadata (YAML) of each file to PostgreSQL database. From there on I can connect to the database and analyse my journal entries with Python. Nice thing is that, this can be done to any kind of notes (not restricted to journal files). Say for instance I can analyse meeting notes etc. Here is the brief workflow:

1. Keep taking notes in Obsidian
	1. Important to have consistent metadata (YAML) section. Some example things that can be tracked/recorded are: date, mood, weather, location etc.
2. Download the PostgreSQL [plugin](https://github.com/clouedoc/postgresql-obsidian) for Obsidian
	1. After taking a note (journal, meeting etc) use this plugin to send the files metadata to PostgreSQL database.
3. Use SQL in Python to analyse and visualise notes. In [this Github repo](https://github.com/natarslan/Obsidian-PostgreSQL-Python) you can follow all the steps. 

The steps in Python are briefly:
1. Connect to the PostgreSQL database in jupyter notebook (python): Â 
	> %sql postgresql://username:password@host:port/database

2. Create an SQL query. Example:
	> query =  ''' 
	> 	SELECT 
		    dataview_data -> 'date' as date,
		    dataview_data -> 'tags' as tags,
		    dataview_data -> 'mood' as mood, 
		    dataview_data -> 'geom' as geom
		    FROM obsidian.file; 
		    '''
	
3. Convert the data from the database into pandas using an SQL query and SQLAlchemy engine: 
   > df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

4. Edit dataframe if necessary 
5. Convert dataframe to GeoPandas and map with IpyLeaflet
6. Plot data
7. Use Streamlit to create a dashboard if you prefer
